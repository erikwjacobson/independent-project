# Independent Project

#### Created by: Erik Jacobson

This application started as a small research project that was required for a psychology course that I took in the spring of 2018. Over the course of my undergraduate career, this project bloomed into a full blown research project, which tested nearly 90 participants and was awarded an outstanding presentation certificate at an undergraduate research conference. In the future, I hope to further study the implications of this project and explore the new ways in which we communicate with each other online and through text messaging.

**Please note that I am not accepting any contributions to this project at this time.
