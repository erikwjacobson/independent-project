# Independent Project

#### Created by: Erik Jacobson
This application was created to complete an independent research project in my 
undergraduate psychology course Research Methods & Design.

### Setup:

* `git clone` the repository
* cd `/path/to/repository`
* Run `composer install`
* Host it on your webserver of choice (I use vagrant homestead)
* Run `php artisan key:generate`
* Run `php artisan migrate --seed`


**Please note that I am not accepting any contributions to this project at this time.
